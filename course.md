    Variables (var, let and const)
    http://es6-features.org/#Constants

Naina - Create a file like 'lesson1-comments.js'
Comments // one line comment
/_
multi line
comment
_/

    hashbang syntax
    #!/usr/bin/env

Naina - Create a file like 'lesson2-variables.js'

    Variable Declarations
    var - Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
    let - Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
    const - Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).

    Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).

    You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.

    Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.

Grammer and Types
6 Data Types (Primitives) typeof operator 1. undefined 2. boolean ex: true 3. number ex: 10 4. string ex: 'Hello' 5. bigint ex: 10n 6. symbol
2 Structural Types instanceof operator 1. object (Object, Array, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, Date all made with new keyword) 2. function
1 Structural Root Primitive 1. null

    Type Conversion

    Literals
        Array literals
        Boolean literals
        Floating-point literals
        Numeric literals
        Object literals
        RegExp literals
        String literals
            Template literals
            Unicode (amazing)
