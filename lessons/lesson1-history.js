What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is very important and for the 7th year in a row, has been ranked the most commonly
used programming language. It has been used to build almost 95% of websites and without
it the several helpful web applications would not have the power they have today. JS is a
scripting language that helps add functionality and behaviors to the website, allowing viewers 
to interact with web content in a unique way. It is also a client-side language, meaning it 
runs on a computer within the browseer mainly. JS is also very easy to learn, hence why it
surpassed many previous languages. 

Origins of JavaScript

The internet was booming in the mid-1990s, as Microsoft and Netscape were engaged in browser wars.
In September 1995, Netscape programmer Brandan Eich developed a new language in just 10 days (crazy), 
and originally named it Mocha (oo coffee), then known as LiveScript, and now finally JavaScript. 
However, JavaScript should not be confused with Java as the two have barely anytning in common.
JavaScript is named after Netscape's support of Java applets within the browser. JavaScript is also
much more dynamic as it was created to be interpreted at run time which Java code must first be compiled.
JS also wasn't perfect at first as many saw it as "UI Glue" and not a true language. But it helped the
internet flourish and therefore it spread rapidly soon after. In 1997, JavaScript grew so rapidly that
the need for proper management and maintenance was needed. Netscape created ECMA(several versions) 
which stands for European Computer Manufacturers Association, whose goal was standardized computing. 
Ajax was introduced in 2005, which was supposed to improve user experience by allowing web pages to feel 
more native like desktopapps. This helped push JavaScript in becoming a professional programming language. 
JS had challenges too withincompatibility issues on browsers, so the CS community responded with frameworks 
and libraries to help solve those issues. JavaScript may have had a slightly rocky start, but it became one 
of the best programming languages and will be for years to come. 

Why is JavaScript important?

JavaScript is one of the crucial languages web developers must learn alongside HTML and CSS
HTML describes the content of web pages, accesses information through links, and uses tags
to tell the browser how to display the information. CSS specifies the layout of web pages 
and how the information should be displayed with a specific formatting style. JavaScript is
helpful in programming the behavior of web pages, using HTML and CSS to help it perform its 
useful methods.
